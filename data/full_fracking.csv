Putman','Wyoming. Important shale deposits are also found in other parts of the world. With diminishing world petroleum reserves and accelerating world demand for petroleum products there exits a necessity for developing a commercially feasible process for recovering the hy- drocarbon values from other sources. The organic matter contained within oil shale is gen- erally referred to as kerogen. This material generally oc- curs as 10 to 20 percent of the total weight of the shale, the remainder being inorganic, but this range of organic matter may be as low as 1% or less or as high as about 40%. One method for the recovery of hydrocarbons from oil shale involves mining of the shale by conven- tional methods and heating it in a separate step to 800° to 1000° F. to volatilize or destructively distill the hydro- carbon materjals therefrom. Such a heating or destruc- tive distillation step is generally referred to as retort- ing the shale.
